Version 1.4.11
--------------

pbsjobs: Fixed error found with some Torque versions: The job start time "start=0" is a bug.
Try to calculate a sensible wait-time despite this.

pbsacct: User accounting generalized: A user may now belong to several groups.
Usage in each group will be accounted separately.

pbsacct: Sanity check for empty accounting file.

Defining AWK=/bin/gawk in several scripts allows setting your system's awk version.

Version 1.4.9
-------------

Fixed missing $ character in pbsacct.
Thanks to "Passerone, Daniele" <Daniele.Passerone@empa.ch>.

Version 1.4.8
-------------

pbsjobs:
	Added check for negative waittime because PBSPro may give starttime=0 for job arrays
	(thanks to Alexis Quentin <quentin@iap.fr>).

Version 1.4.7
-------------

pbsjobs:
	Introduced TORQUEHOME variable (thanks to kong.lists@gmail.com)
pbsnodect:
	Added a comment about counting of days when timezone goes to/from DST,
	this may for example cause October to be counted as 32 days.
	A better solution would be to count fractional days due to DST transitions.
pbsacct:
	Fixed missing $ in front of MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY variable.

Version 1.4.6
-------------

pbsjobhist:
        NEW SCRIPT: Produce a Torque/PBS job history from the accounting records.
        This may be useful for tracking job histories of individual jobs, or
        those jobs belonging to specific users and groups.
        Usage:
           cat [accounting-files] | pbsjobhist
        Accounting files are usually in /var/spool/torque/server_priv/accounting/.
        Please make sure that the accounting-files covers the entire period that you're
        interested in, since some jobs will usually fall outside this period.
        Output: One line per job containing:
           job-id username group list-of-event-timestamps
        The job events are mainly: Q (queued), S (started), E (ended).  Additional
        event types are listed in the script. If available, the CPU-time, Wallclock-time
        and Queue-wait-time are printed.
pbsacct:
        * Fixed wrong column used in the sort command (now uses SORTCOLUMN).
        * Introduced a variable MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY with default value "SHARED"
        for those sites that account by entire nodes in stead of CPU cores used,
        see the explanation under pbsjobs below.
        * Make a check for zero accounting lines in input files.
pbsreportmonth:
        Configure SUBSCRIBERS and SYSTEMNAME for your local environment.
pbsnodect:
        * Calculate number of days from first to last job.
        Previously we just counted the number of accounting files, but on
        systems with very few jobs there may be gaps in the daily accounting
        files.
        * Assume a default np=1 in the Torque nodes file if np= is absent.
        * Introduced a variable MAUI_NODEACCESSPOLICY with default value "SHARED"
        for those sites that account by entire nodes in stead of CPU cores used,
        see the explanation under pbsjobs below.
        * Make a check for zero accounting lines in input files.
pbsjobs: 
       * Calculate number of CPU cores used from the exec_host record, in stead of
       the Resource_List.nodes used previously.
       * Introduced an optional argument -S (for "Single").
       This should be used if you use the MAUI scheduler's single
       job/task/user per node features SINGLEUSER/SINGLEJOB/SINGLETASK, see
       http://www.clusterresources.com/products/maui/docs/5.3nodeaccess.shtml.
       In this case a job is charged for the use of an ENTIRE NODE in stead of
       the default, which is the actual number of processors used within each
       node. Requested by Niels Carl Hansen <recnh@cscaa.dk>.
       We get the node's #CPU cores from the Torque "nodes" file.
       NOTE: One caveat is required: If the system was changed after the accounting
       record was made, a nodename may have disappeared from the "nodes"
       file, and hence we have lost all memory of this node's #CPU cores.
       In this case we only account for the actual #CPU cores used.
       Therefore the accounting script should NOT be rerun after changes have
       been made to the nodes in the system, otherwise the results may become
       inaccurate !
       * Make a check for pbs_server logfiles in stead of accounting files.


Version 1.4.5
-------------
pbsnodect:
        * Added calculation of NUM_CPUS from the Torque nodes file.
        * Now reports the number of CPU cores (processors) in stead of nodes.
pbsjobs:
        * Added job start and end times (in epoch seconds since 1970) to output of "pbsjobs".
         Some functions are easier to implement when times are given in epoch seconds.
         The pbsacct and pbsnodect were changed to read start and end from pbsjobs.
pbsacct and pbsnodect:
        * Report first and last job from the actual accounting records,
         in stead of using just the name of the accounting files.

Version 1.4.4
-------------
pbsacct:
        * Fixed a group accounting bug in "pbsacct -G" when a group has the same name as some user.
pbsacct:
        * Changed the argument to the "sort" command in pbsacct to comply with more modern syntax.
pbsacct:
        * Fixed syntax of a "test" command in pbsacct to comply with more modern syntax.
         Thanks to Chris Vaughan <chris@clusterresources.com>

Version 1.4.3
-------------
pbsacct:
        * Added the flag -G to pbsacct so that a summary of group accounting data is printed.
        * The command pbsacctgroup is replaced by pbsacct -G
